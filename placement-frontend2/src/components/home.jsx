            C-DAC placements create a platform where students can showcase their
            talents which different companies seek to explore and utilize.
            Starting from 1993, we have successfully placed a large section of
            graduates who have appeared for placements. This year especially,
            the performance has been overwhelming. The moment you step foot at
            C-DAC, the process of shaping and moulding you for the real world
            begins. From day one itself, the focus is to get one ready to bag
            the best possible offer from industry bigwigs, at the end of six
            months when the Post Graduate Diploma programmes culminate.

            C-DAC helps students in exploring placement opportunities by
            inviting companies for Common Campus Placement Programme. The final
            placements at C-DAC are a culmination of systematic and continued
            interaction with industry and ongoing and enduring career
            counselling as well as grooming of the students by mentors and
            Career Development Centre. And before the “Placement” day, we
            finally present the podium where thousands of students participate
            in National Level Common Campus Placement Programme (CCPP) in five
            regions: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Noida, Patna and Pune where
            more than 500 companies across India visit for recruitment.
